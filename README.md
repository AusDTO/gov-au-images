# `gov.au` Beta Media Repository
Welcome to the media repository for images and other media used on the gov.au Beta.  Please note that this is a temporary (and unfortunately painful) solution until a more permanent image upload feature is provided by the content authoring tool. 

## Uploading images and getting a URL to use in the `gov.au` beta
:point_right: [**Instructional video on how to upload and use images**](https://vimeo.com/174626414/a9d3a34c4b)

1. Click the [Upload Files](https://github.com/AusDTO/gov-au-images/upload/master) button above
2. Follow the on-screen to drag-and-drop or choose one or many files to upload
3. When all the uploads have complete, make sure that `Commit directly to the master branch` is selected, and then click the `Commit Changes` button.  :warning: Please ensure that the filename(s) of the file(s) you're uploading don't already exist in the repository, as they'll be overwritten by your upload.
4. Your uploaded files will now be visible in the repository Code (aka Files) list.  Click on the filename of the image to load the image
5. Confirm the image is the one you have uploaded, then copy the URL from the browser address bar into your clipboard
6. Navigate to [rawgit.com](https://rawgit.com), and paste the URL into the field at the top of the page.
7. Copy the URL from the field under `Use this URL in production`
